## Linear search

**Linear search is a method for finding a particular value in a list. It works by checking each element in the list one by one until the desired value is found. If the value is not found, the search will return -1.**

## Binary search

**Binary search is a more efficient method for finding a particular value in a list. It works by repeatedly dividing the list in half until the desired value is found. Binary search is only faster than linear search if the list is sorted.**
