## Linked List

**A linked list is a data structure that consists of a collection of nodes. Each node consists of two parts: a data field and a pointer to the next node in the list. The last node in the list points to null. Linked lists are often used to implement stacks and queues.**

#### Advantages

**Linked lists have several advantages over arrays. First, linked lists can be dynamically allocated, which means that they can grow or shrink as needed. Second, linked lists can be inserted and deleted from anywhere in the list, without having to shift all of the other elements in the list**

#### Disadvantages

**However, linked lists also have some disadvantages. First, linked lists can be slower than arrays because they require following the pointers from one node to the next. Second, linked lists can use more memory than arrays because each node contains a pointer.**
